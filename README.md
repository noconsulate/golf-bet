Note to potential employers:
This was originally intended as a full-fledged PWA and is unfinished. I no longer intend on finishing it but it should stand to demonstrate some of my coding skills. There is some sloppy code in here, especially when it comes to managing state and keeping track of which views to render and when. Some things don't make sense, like having my database calls in a folder called "bridges" when they aren't really bridges. There are more than a few bugs. The project is too big in scope for me to finish myself and the business idea I built it for fell apart so I'm leaving it as it is.

Thanks for looking!
